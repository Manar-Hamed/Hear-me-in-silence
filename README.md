# Hear Me in Silence: Multilingual Sign Language Vision-BasedÂ Translation

This is a project that aims to develop a system capable of translating sign language into multiple spoken languages and vice versa, using computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. This project seeks to bridge communication gaps between deaf and hearing communities by providing an accessible, efficient, and accurate translation tool that can understand and produce sign language in real-time.

The successful implementation of this project could significantly enhance communication access for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, fostering more inclusive societies. Achieving this goal requires interdisciplinary collaboration among computer scientists, linguists, sign language experts, and community stakeholders.
